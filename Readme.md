# Integrating Google Analytics with Cloudinary Media Player
This is a demo integrating Google analytics with Cloudinary Video player.

After Google Analytics has been integrated, individual events such as Pause, Play, Volume-Change, Percent-Played, Video Load and Player Load can be tracked and seen on Google analytics.

To use this player simply:

```bash
npm install
```
This installs all required dependencies.

After installation of dependencies, start the server with:

```bash
npm run start
```
The app is run on [localhost:1995](localhost:1995)

To use [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com) and [Google Analytics](analytics.google.com), create an account on both platforms following their steps carefully to setup tracking on your website.
